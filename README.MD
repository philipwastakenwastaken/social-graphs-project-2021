# Social Graphs: Text Analysis of [Avatar]("https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Wiki")

## Overview

This project, "Social Graphs", represents a comprehensive data analysis initiative focused on the extraction and examination of textual content from the popular TV series, [TV Series Name]. By employing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we have transformed the intricate web of character interactions and dialogues into an informative graph structure. This approach not only elucidates the dynamic relationships between characters but also uncovers underlying themes and patterns within the narrative.

## Key Features

- **Graph-Based Analysis**: Conversion of character interactions into a graph for in-depth relational analysis.
- **NLP Techniques**: Utilization of cutting-edge NLP methods to process and analyze the text, including:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and classify proper names.
  - Sentiment Analysis to gauge the emotional undertones of dialogues.
  - Topic Modeling to discover the latent topics within the text.
  - Co-occurrence Analysis to explore the strength and dynamics of character interactions.
